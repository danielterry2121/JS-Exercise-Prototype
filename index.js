  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

  TASK 1
   check - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
  check  - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
        + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
        + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
    - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
        + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
    - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
        + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

        + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
        + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
    - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
        + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

/* 
  TASK 4

  In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
  1. The first principle is the global binding feature this has to it's own unique functions even outside of objects and their constructors , it can be applied globally.
  2. The second Is implicit Binding , For me this was the first obvious use, inside of an object to manipulate things inside itself, if i want to add a new function to take the calories and fat andf return a ratio , I just say this , no accessing like arrays arr[lay1][lay2][index2300]
  3. The third is by far the most useful application of this with new binding. You can set up pre-determined factors for newly constructed object with this!
  4. The final is "explicit" binding , which from what I understand is usefull to call in on the parent object to sort of mimic classes in other languages and even produce working object oriented design.
